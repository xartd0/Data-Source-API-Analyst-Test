# Data Cleaning Approach

## Overview
After extracting data from the GitHub API, it's essential to clean and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and consistency for analysis.
Steps

### 1. Data Validation

    Schema Validation: Verify that the data conforms to the expected schema.
    Data Types: Ensure that fields have the correct data types (e.g., dates, numbers, strings).

### 2. Handling Missing Values

    Identify Missing Data: Look for null or missing fields in the data.
    Imputation: Decide whether to fill missing values or remove incomplete records.
    Consistency Checks: Ensure related fields are consistent (e.g., created_at and updated_at dates).

### 3. Duplicate Detection

    Unique Identifiers: Use unique fields like id, sha, or node_id to detect duplicates.
    Deduplication: Remove duplicate records from the dataset.

### 4. Normalization

    Date Formats: Convert date strings to datetime objects for consistency.
    Text Normalization: Standardize text fields (e.g., lowercasing, removing extra spaces).
    Encoding: Ensure text data is correctly encoded (e.g., UTF-8).

### 5. Data Transformation

    Flattening Nested Structures: Convert nested JSON objects to flat tables if necessary.
    Feature Extraction: Derive new features from existing data (e.g., extract domains from URLs).

### 6. Outlier Detection

    Statistical Methods: Identify and handle outliers in numerical data.
    Anomaly Detection: Use techniques to find unusual patterns in the data.

### 7. Data Enrichment

    Augmentation: Enrich the data by adding relevant external information if needed.
    Linking Data: Merge data from different sources based on common keys.

## Tools and Libraries

    Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
    NumPy: For numerical computations.
    Dateutil: For parsing and handling dates.
    JSON Schema: For validating JSON data structures.

## Best Practices

    Modular Code: Write reusable functions for data cleaning tasks.
    Documentation: Document each step of the data cleaning process.
    Version Control: Keep track of data transformations using version control.
    Testing: Implement tests to verify the correctness of data cleaning functions.
