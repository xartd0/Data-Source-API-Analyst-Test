# Troubleshooting Guide
## Common Issues and Solutions
### 1. 401 Unauthorized Error

Cause: Invalid or missing authentication token.

Solutions:

    Verify that the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is correctly set.
    Ensure the token has the necessary scopes/permissions.
    Check if the token has expired or been revoked.

### 2. 403 Forbidden Error

Cause: Rate limit exceeded or access to a forbidden resource.

Solutions:

    Check the rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset).
    Implement rate limit handling (sleep until reset time).
    Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

### 3. 404 Not Found Error

Cause: Incorrect endpoint, owner, repository, or path.

Solutions:

    Verify the owner and repository names are correct.
    Check the path provided for accessing repository contents.
    Ensure the resource exists and is accessible.

### 4. ConnectionError or Timeout

Cause: Network issues or slow response from the API.

Solutions:

    Implement retries with exponential backoff.
    Check your internet connection.
    Ensure that there are no firewalls blocking the requests.

### 5. JSON Decode Error

Cause: Response is not in JSON format.

Solutions:

    Ensure the Accept header is set to 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'.
    Check if the API returned an error page or HTML content.

Rate Limit Handling

    Always check the X-RateLimit-Remaining header in the response.
    If the remaining limit is 0, sleep until the X-RateLimit-Reset time.
    Use the check_rate_limit() function to automate this process.
